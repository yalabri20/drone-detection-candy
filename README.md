Project Title: Candy Detection Using Drones üç¨üöÅ

Description:

This project utilizes deep learning and computer vision to detect different types of candies using a drone. By leveraging YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection and OpenCV for image processing, the system identifies and classifies various candy types from aerial footage.

Key Features:
	‚Ä¢	Real-time candy detection using drone-captured images.
	‚Ä¢	Deep learning-based classification with a pre-trained YOLO model.
	‚Ä¢	Optimized for edge devices to run efficiently on drones.
	‚Ä¢	Python-based implementation with OpenCV and TensorFlow.

Technologies Used:
	‚Ä¢	Python
	‚Ä¢	OpenCV
	‚Ä¢	YOLO Model
	‚Ä¢	TensorFlow/Keras
	‚Ä¢	Drone Tello
